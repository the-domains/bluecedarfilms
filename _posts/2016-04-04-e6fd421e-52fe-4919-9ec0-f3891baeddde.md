We are a British film production company.

Blue Cedar strives on creating high quality films, Documentaries, music videos, commercial  and promos.  

Founded by Matthew Steggles and James Bowsher. Blue Cedar started from where it began, in Matthew's Garden, next to his Cedar Tree. The base of production. In the middle of the night, the large Cedar fell to the ground. However when you get knocked down, you got to get up again. Our logo represents us getting up. We will not stay down. Neither will our films or the characters in our movies.
